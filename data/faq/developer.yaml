- question: Why should I implement SimpleLogin on my website instead of Facebook/Google login?
  answer: >
    That's a very good question! Do you know that Facebook and Google use these buttons to <a
        href="https://dev.to/simplelogin/if-you-care-about-user-privacy-do-not-use-facebook-js-sdk-1j3e">track</a>
      your users browsing history so that they can provide more personalized ads? And do you get any of
      these ad-generated revenue? <br>
    SimpleLogin, with a transparent pricing model (you know where our revenue comes from) with a single
    product that focus solely on improving the login experiences yet still giving users total control over
    their data, does not have any incentive to utilize your user data. <br>
    In addition, we believe in a fair model: users come to your website because your website brings value
    to them and we are in a win-win relationship, so you deserve to have a share of the benefit.


- question: Ok, got it. But how about the recent "Sign in with Apple" ?
  answer: >
    About Apple, they claim to not selling your users data to advertisers but being an advertiser
        themselves, how can we be sure ... <br>
        Apple can also be considered as an ad platform with their Apple Search Ads so better to not put Apple
        in a (much) higher position than Facebook or Google in terms of privacy. <br>
        Arguments about transparent pricing and fair model apply to Apple too ðŸ˜‰

- question: Why should I trust SimpleLogin?
  answer: >
    SimpleLogin code is fully open-source on <a href="https://github.com/simple-login">Github</a> and
    can be self-hosted. Anyone can freely audit the code or setup their own SimpleLogin server. <br>
    SimpleLogin revenue is based on a transparent and sustainable model that allows us to have a
    privacy-first and tracker-free product.

- question: Do you plan to release a SDK to support native, windows, etc app?
  answer: >
    Yes absolutely! We started with the web platform simply because they can be used for mobile app as
    well via a Android WebView or IOS UIWebView. We plan to provide a SDK and some examples for Android,
    iOS, Windows quite soon. Stay tuned!

- question: How does the "revenue sharing" work?
  answer: >
    The current advertising model is based on an unfair model where big players (Google, Facebook, etc)
        take almost all benefit and app/content creators get almost nothing. We strongly believe a
        sustainable model should be fair: our partners should get an important part of the revenue because
        together with SimpleLogin, we provide a great login experience to user while respecting user privacy
        at the same time.
    <br>

      The revenue formula is still work-in-progress as we need to take into account different factors
      (mostly payment processing fee and tax rate) but hopefully this can give you a rough idea on how it
      works.
    <br>

      The payment period is monthly and works as following: <br>
      - a user John opts for the premium subscription. John pays 20$/year. After processing fee and taxes,
      let's assume SimpleLogin receives 12$ net (this number is quite optimist in France ðŸ˜‰), which is
      1$/month. Half of this will be distributed to partners. <br>
      - John uses N apps that implement SimpleLogin: each app will get an equal part of the revenue.
    <br>

      Let's put this into a concrete example. The following numbers are of course hypothesis.<br>
      - the average number of app a user uses per month is about 10, half of them implement SimpleLogin,
      that makes N=5. <br>
      - you have a website/app that has 1M users, half of them use SingleLogin and 10% of them are paying
      customers, that is 1 000 000*0.5*0.1=50 000 paying users.
    <br>

      Using our formula, each month you will receive: <br>
      monthly_revenue = total_number_of_paying_user * 1/2 * monthly_net_revenue / average_app_number <br>
    <br>

      monthly_revenue = 50000 * 1/2 * 1 / 5 = 5000$
    <br>
