- question: What happens to my aliases when I stop the subscription?
  answer: >
    When your subscription ends, all aliases you created continue working normally, both on receiving and
        sending emails. Concretely: <br>
    - All aliases/domains/directories/mailboxes you have created are kept and continue working normally. <br>
    - You cannot create new aliases if you exceed the free plan limit, i.e. have more than 15 aliases. <br>
    - As features like catch-all or directory allow you to create aliases on-the-fly, those aliases cannot be
    automatically created if you have more than 15 aliases. <br>
    - You cannot add new domain, directory or mailbox. <br><br>

    For example, if you have 100 aliases by the time your subscription ends, these
    100 aliases will continue receiving and sending emails normally. You cannot however create new aliases.

- question: What happens when I reach the maximum number of alias in free plan?
  answer: >
    If you are in the free plan, you cannot create new aliases when you reach the maximum number of aliases
        (i.e. 15 aliases). <br>
    Aliases that would otherwise be created automatically via the catch-all domain or directory feature also
    cannot be created. <br>

- question: Do you offer discounts?
  answer: >
    We offer students a premium license for free during the scholarship.
    Just send us an email to <a href="mailto:edu@simplelogin.io">edu@simplelogin.io</a> from your school email (typically a .edu address) along with your SimpleLogin account so we can upgrade your account to 1 year of premium plan. If you don't have a school email address, a copy of your student card or another equivalent document suffices. <br><br>

    By the end of each period (i.e. every year), you'll receive a reminder email to renew the license. If you are a student by that time, please send us another email from your .edu account for verification so that your license can be extended for another year. <br><br>

    We also offer important discounts or free premium for: <br>

    - professors or technical staffs working at an educational institute <br>
    - activists, dissidents or journalists <br>
    - charity organizations <br>

    Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:hi@simplelogin.io">hi@simplelogin.io</a> for more info. <br><br>
