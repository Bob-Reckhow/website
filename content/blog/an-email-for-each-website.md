> Why do I receive so many spams?

When this question was asked by my girlfriend (now wife 😅), my immediate answer was "Stop giving away your email" and I suggested creating a secondary email for "suspicious" websites. Also, using the same email everywhere is like leaving the same **footprint** on the Internet, allowing advertisers to `cross-reference` your online behavior.

She followed the advice, created a second email and was happy at first. But now she doesn't even check this mailbox as there are so many spams in it 💁🏻‍♀️.

So creating a second email is not a true solution. She needs more than 2, maybe hundreds. **And why not an email for each website**? But she cannot go to Gmail or Outlook to create hundreds of accounts, this is unmanageable. There must be a better way.

The solution is `email alias`. An alias is a normal email address but all emails sent to an alias will be **forwarded** to your real email address. Alias acts therefore as a **shield** (or a proxy) for your real email address. An alias can be disabled anytime, making the spams stop.

Nowadays, some websites allow to unsubscribe quickly but a lot of them still make unsubscribing a difficult process. Some wouldn't even honor the request. And this doesn't stop the websites from cross-referencing your data with your email being the common key.

Let's make spammers' life harder with email alias!
