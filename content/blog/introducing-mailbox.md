Our most requested feature is finally ready: you can now add several **real** email addresses into SimpleLogin and choose which one to use when creating aliases! A real email address is called **mailbox** in SimpleLogin.

This feature is particularly useful if you have several email addresses, maybe for different uses: a Gmail account for social networks & forums, a Prontonmail account for professional emails, etc.

When creating an alias, you can choose which mailbox that *owns* this alias, meaning:

- emails sent to this alias are **forwarded** to the owning mailbox.

- the owning mailbox can **send** or reply emails from this alias.

You can also change the owning mailbox for an existing alias.

The mailbox doesn't have to be your personal email: you can also create aliases for your friend by adding his/her email as a mailbox.

You can create and manage mailboxes on your [dashboard](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/mailbox).

Adding additional mailboxes is available in the Premium plan or during the trial period. Same for other features: mailboxes created during the trial period are kept and continue working normally when the trial ends.
