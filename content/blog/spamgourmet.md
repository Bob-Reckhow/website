I learned about [Spamgourmet](https://www.spamgourmet.com/index.pl) via a friend who has been using the service for more than 10 years. Even though I couldn't create a new account on Spamgourmet (the registration is closed), I only heard nice things about this service.

The website seems out of date with its yellowish background and it's indeed old: it has been running since 2000! The service is free and if people like it, they could donate or buy a T-Shirt. Spamgourmet is also [open-source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spamgourmet/) so anyone could run it on their server.

A simple, honest, transparent service like Spamgourmet is a great inspiration for SimpleLogin because of several reasons:

* **email alias** is a real need.

* no important change has arrived to this domain for a long time.

* if well done, running an email alias service is actually inexpensive.

Then I stumbled upon this [sad topic](https://bbs.spamgourmet.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1766&sid=91eafca02c8f811e2bdc390a01a3870f). Josh, Spamgourmet maintainer got brain cancer at the terminal phase. It's touching to see how people appreciate his works. I hope one day I would be able to create a service that has so much love from its users.


For those who might ask, is SimpleLogin a concurrent to Spamgourmet? Actually no because:

- Spamgourmet Alias (or `address`) is temporary by design: by default, an alias can only receive up to [20 emails](https://www.spamgourmet.com/index.pl?printpage=faq.html) unless you use the Advanced Mode. A SimpleLogin alias is designed as an email replacement and is permanent unless you delete it.
- Spamgourmet targets at "geeky" people, hence the technical feel of the website. SimpleLogin targets the general public.
- Spamgourmet goal is to avoid spams. While SimpleLogin alias also protects users from spams, SimpleLogin's ambition is to offer an alternative to the "Sign in with Facebook|Google|Apple" button and make alias a complete replacement to email.
- Spamgourmet registration is now closed.
- And more importantly, the market is big enough for all email alias services. Most of the people I talk with don't know about the existence of email alias and its benefit. Time is more spent on market education than competing with concurrences.

All the best to Josh.
