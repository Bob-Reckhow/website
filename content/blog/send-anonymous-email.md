Email alias (or email forwarding) solutions are often designed for only **receiving** emails but with SimpleLogin, you can also **send** anonymous emails from the comfort of your usual mailbox. Some advantages of using your mailbox:

- the email is there so you can search for it in the future
- you can use all features supported by your email service such as attachment, HTML formatting, etc

This article is going to show you to send an email anonymously with SimpleLogin.

An anonymous email address is called an "alias" in SimpleLogin. Emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your real mailbox.

There are several ways of creating an alias in SimpleLogin. In this article we'll use the most frequent way which is via the SimpleLogin [Chrome/Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/simpleloginreceive-sen/diacfpipniklenphgljfkmhinphjlfff) extension.


Click on the extension icon to create a new alias. Here we are using going to create anonymous.ifckb@aleeas.com

Once the alias is created, click on the send icon:

![](/blog/send-email/reverse-alias.png)

Enter the address you want to send emails to and hit "Create a reverse-alias"

![](/blog/send-email/contact.png)

It will create an address called "reverse alias"

![](/blog/send-email/copy-reverse-alias.png)

Copy this address and send the email to this address instead of the original address.

And voil√†, the email will be sent from your alias anonymous.ifckb@aleeas.com and your real address stays hidden.

The process might seem a bit complex but trust us here, the second email is going to be easier and using reverse alias will become natural. You can learn more about what exactly is a reverse alias on [reverse alias demystification](https://simplelogin.io/docs/getting-started/reverse-alias/)
