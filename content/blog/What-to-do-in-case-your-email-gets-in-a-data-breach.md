## **How Aliases Make Things So Much Simpler?**

Before we dive into how to check email data breaches or what to do if my email has been breached, you must create email aliases. 

The fact is that email aliases make it a lot easier for you to **kill the switch and prevent further damage**. You can use a service like Simple Login to create email aliases within seconds. 

Even if you use our free plan, you will get to generate 15 aliases and benefit from 1 mailbox. We also offers unlimited reply/send from aliases and unlimited bandwidth. 

Other email alias solutions are fine too - just stick to whatever is comfortable to you (but we hope you'll give us a try).

Simple Login also offers **integration with** [**Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)**](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to provide all the information you require in case of a breach. If there is a breach, the service would immediately let you know so that you can appropriate actions.

You can check email data breaches the moment there is a breach. It does not get better than this!

Understanding the importance of aliases is crucial for avoiding the possibility of a breached email. They also allow you to save money as you would not need to spend money on purchasing business email addresses.

## **My Email Has Been Leaked And What Should I Do?**

Password leaked in data breaches has become more common than you think. Let's take a look at email data breaches and what to do about it:

## **1\. Run Antivirus Software**

The first thing you should do after you check email data breaches is to run an antivirus software. Run an end-to-end scan as soon as you know that your account has been hacked. There is no point in doing a quick scan. 

Please note this is not correlated to the email data breach itself, but it's an extra security measure you can take to assess your overall computer health.

You should stick to a deep scan for identifying and eliminating all types of malware (spyware, Trojans, and keyloggers tracking every keystroke) and unwanted applications.

Hackers are not interested in sending embarrassing messages to your contacts. What they are after is your money and committing credit card fraud.

## **2\. Change Your Passwords**

Next, **you need to change your passwords**. Once the deep scan is complete, your computer should be free of malware.

Once you assured your physical devices are free of malware, you can go ahead and take care of your digital information.

**Every account you had linked to the email alias is at risk**. Please take your time to investigate where you created accounts with that alias and change your password inside the application.

This is the most important reason why we suggest you create a new alias for each service you subscribe to.

**One alias = one risk.**

If your main email address gets into a data breach, you might need to change your password in hundreds of services.

We know because... we made that mistake.

Trust us: it's not fun.

However, if you have **one alias connected to one service only**, once it gets into a data breach you only have to change one password.

It's extremely convenient, and once you get into the first breach (it happens to the best ones) you'll notice how much easier your life has been thanks to email aliases.

## **3\. Manage Other Online Services**

If you didn't use an alias, and you had your personal email connected to lots of services before it got into the breach, things can get ugly.

Please make sure you change your passwords on all online services, especially **payment-based accounts** such as the local library, credit card companies, Netflix, and Amazon. **Update each password to prevent hackers from comprising any other account.**

You must **immediately change your passwords** for every other online service and keep these accounts secure. Secondary services tend to be more valuable as hackers perform a breach to access these services via your details. 

For instance, your bank account could get hacked, and you could lose all your money. Make sure that each account has a unique password. There is always a risk of follow-up breaches. Avoid streamlining logins through your email or social media account to reduce further risk. 

## **4\. Notify People You Know**

When your email gets in a data breach, you also have a responsibility to **protect your contact list.** Let your friends, family members, and colleagues know that you have been hacked to ensure that hackers do not compromise your relationship with them. 

After hackers gain control over an account, they tend to **send hundreds of malware-laden emails to every contact.** It is a phishing attempt to exploit new victims.

Protect your family and friends by letting them know what happened and what steps you're taking to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Also, make sure to clarify **they're not at risk** as long as they don't interact with emails or messages sent by the hackers.

## **5\. Change the Security Questions**

The security questions are there for a reason. They help improve protection. Although knowing your password is the most likely attack route, hackers can also break into your account after answering security questions. 

Subvert the possibility of hackers breaking in again by entering false answers to security questions. They should simply be memorable.

However, **avoid answers that are easy to discover through your public information**. Instead of going for a generic answer like pizza for a question such as “What is your favorite food?” You should think of something unique. A better response would be biryani, nasi lemak, or pirogue. 

## **6\. Report the Hack**

In addition to the above, you must report the hack. **Tell your email provider about the hack.**

It is crucial that you do so even if you have not suffered much loss. When you report a hack, it helps providers keep track of scam-based behavior.

Not only do you protect yourself by reporting a hack, but you also get to protect others from future threats. Your email provider might also share details about the nature or origin of the attack. 

## **7\. Create a New Email Account**

The worst mistake that you can make is picking up where you left off. Think about why your email got hacked.

It's possible that your provider does not take the necessary steps for mitigating spam received. Hence, you might want to make a switch. 

**Select a service that provides default encryption for emails**. Keep your private emails concealed with data encryption even if the server gets breached. Unless hackers have the proper security key, they would be unable to unlock your data.

We suggest you use [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). And again, this step is only necessary if you didn't use aliases.

## **8\. Contact Credit Agencies**

As mentioned above, hackers have a far greater reach than just hacking into an email. This is why it makes sense to reach out to credit reporting agencies to monitor your accounts from the day of the hack carefully. 

Take note of any suspicious named emails that you might have responded to or contacted. Fraudsters know how to make personal contact and convince you to provide your personal details. Avoid falling for their trap as they are masters of personal touch.

## **9\. Enable 2FA**

If it wasn't active already, take the leap and activate 2FA. It's extremely important as that guarantees hackers cannot get into your account unless they have access to two of your devices at the same time.

It radically improves your security and minimises the risk of anything serious happening during a data breach.

## **10\. Become Completely Secure**

Finally, you need to make sure this doesn't happen again.

**The reality is more comforting than what you're seeing right now.**

Data breaches are extremely common, and every email you used probably got into one at some point in the past.

However, most data breaches only include your email, and the hackers are not there to actively steal any information from you, they just want to send a message asking 100$ and wait for 0.001% of people to be scared and reply.

So, please, don't freak out unless the data breach included credit card information or if the email in the breach was connected to government accounts and institution.

It's all good. **You're safe. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.**

However, taking steps to make sure future breaches can get contained easily is your responsability. We suggest you read our guides in the blog to make sure you're prepared - preventing a problem is better than dealing with it.
