Organized for the 5th edition, the "Acteurs du Libre 2021" contest aims to reward companies and entrepreneurs as well as projects and associations that contribute by their actions to the development of Free Software and Open Source. Candidates with clear objectives on the use and contribution to open source projects and tools are particularly rewarded. About 20 companies and projects participated this year in the contest. The award ceremony takes place today during a plenary session of the Open Source Experience, at 1pm in the Salle Maillot.

The award for best open source project this year goes to SimpleLogin for addressing an issue related to the privacy of everyone. SimpleLogin is also rewarded for its rapid development and its ability to federate a real community of developers.
