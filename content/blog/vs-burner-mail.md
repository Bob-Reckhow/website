### Open Source

![Open Source or Closed Source](/blog/vs-burnermail/2.png)

One of the main differences between the two solutions is that **SimpleLogin is completely open-source**. This means the code is constantly audited by countless developers. SimpleLogin can also **be installed on your own servers.**

If for any reason SimpleLogin goes out of business, you can download the code and run it on your own server. Emails contain personal, sensitive information, and therefore open-source email services should be preferred over closed-source, proprietary ones. 

**Open Source and transparency are at the core of who we are and what we do.** Our mission is to provide the best solution to protect your identity online - and email is just the first step in that direction.




### Cross-platform

![Available everywhere](/blog/vs-burnermail/3.png)

SimpleLogin can be used everywhere. It's available on: 

- iOS app store
- Android official store
- Android unofficial stores
- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc), Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Tor Browser, Waterfox, etc), and Safari.

One SimpleLogin account can be used on all of these devices at the same time.

Burner Mail is only available on Web and doesn't provide mobile apps.


### Pricing model

![What do you get](/blog/vs-burnermail/5.png)

Both solutions focus on a SaaS business model, which means you get the software hosted on our servers for a fixed monthly or yearly fee.

Both platforms have a completely free account. 

With **SimpleLogin free tier**, you get 15 aliases. You can send emails or reply from aliases.

With **Burner Mail free tier**, you get 5 aliases. You can't send emails or reply from aliases.

Let's look at the paid plans.

With **SimpleLogin**, you get **unlimited domain names, PGP encryption, and 50 directories at 30$ per year.**

With **Burner Mail**, you get **1 custom domain name, and no encryption for 34$ per year.**

Being Open Source means we need **to compete against ourselves**, as the code is freely available and you can host it and operate your own instance. 

The **competition against ourselves** is what drives the price lower.



### Able to send emails from alias

In order to send an email from an alias, you need to go Burner Mail website and compose the email there. Burner Mail also doesn't support replying to a forwarded email from your email client. 

SimpleLogin supports sending emails from your alias using your usual email client. You can reply to a forwarded email just like a normal email: the email will be sent from your alias and your personal mailbox stays hidden. 

### PGP encryption

![PGP encryption](/blog/vs-burnermail/6.png)

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) allows you to encrypt your emails so your email service can't read the email content. This adds another layer of security, especially for popular email services that don't have PGP built in like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo. 

This method of encryption **significantly increases the security of the messages** you exchange online. 

PGP is provided by default by some email services such as Protonmail or enabled with existing email services via PGP softwares.

SimpleLogin [adds support for PGP on March 2020](/blog/introducing-pgp/). Burner Mail doesn't support PGP at the moment. 


### Crypto Payments

![Crypto payments](/blog/vs-burnermail/7.png)

Burner Mail only accepts fiat payments, as in $, €, or £. This is fine for most people, but not for our customer base and not for the niche we're in. 

More than 25% of our users do not even use Google Properties, so why would we expect them to use standard banking solutions.

SimpleLogin **now integrates with CoinBase Commerce, which means you can pay with your favorite cryptocurrencies at the checkout.** 

This is also another big difference when compared to setting up your own instance, as that will come with a hosting plan which will likely ask for fiat payments.

**We currently support Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, Ethereum, Litecoin, and USD Coin.**



### HaveIBeenPwned integration

![HaveIBeenPwned](/blog/vs-burnermail/8.png)

On all free and paid plans, SimpleLogin integrates with HaveIBeenPwned and lets you know if your alias is exposed in a mail breach. 

This integration is important as it **allows you to quickly turn the alias off as soon as the breach happens**, and protect yourself from unwanted emails or bigger problems that may arise from a data breach (such as stolen identities and/or credit fraud)

Burner Mail does suggest the use of HaveIBeenPwned on their site, but they don't have an active feature protecting your existing aliases.



#### Ease of Use

![What do you get](/blog/vs-burnermail/9.png)

Burner Mail is doing a great job by providing an easy-to-use and intuitive way to introduce people to email aliases. 

UX/UI is one of the challenges for SimpleLogin so email alias can be more mainstream and available to the more people.

We welcome any feedback from existing SimpleLogin users on our UX/UI, so if there's something you'd like to see, don't hesitate to let us know!


#### Conclusions

![Conclusions](/blog/vs-burnermail/10.png)

In conclusion, we believe SimpleLogin could be better for you if you're looking for a privacy-focused solution more than a mainstream burner email address.

Burner Mail is great software, and we support every business revolving around users' privacy.

However, if you need to secure your email content with PGP, add unlimited email domains and have a **more complete experience overall**, SimpleLogin will probably be a better solution for you and your business.
