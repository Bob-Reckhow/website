    Sign In With Apple allows you to hide your email address when subscribing to digital services online. Although that's better than nothing, we believe SimpleLogin provides a more feature-rich solution for your email privacy needs.

### Open Source

![Open Source or Closed Source](/blog/vs-burnermail/2.png)

One of the main differences between the two solutions is that **SimpleLogin is completely open-source**. This means the code is constantly audited by countless developers. SimpleLogin can also **be installed on your own servers.**

If for any reason SimpleLogin goes out of business, you can download the code and run it on your own server. Emails contain personal, sensitive information, and therefore open-source email services should be preferred over closed-source, proprietary ones. 

**Open Source and transparency are at the core of who we are and what we do.** Our mission is to provide the best solution to protect your identity online - and email is just the first step in that direction.

Sign In With Apple is limited to the Apple Ecosystem, and can easily get interrupted for no reason by them.


### Cross-platform

![Available everywhere](/blog/vs-burnermail/3.png)

SimpleLogin can be used everywhere. It's available on: 

- iOS app store
- Android official store
- Android unofficial stores
- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc), Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Tor Browser, Waterfox, etc), and Safari.

One SimpleLogin account can be used on all of these devices at the same time.

Sign in With Apple is only available on Apple Devices, which are usually only affordable for a restricted pool of people.


### Able to send emails from alias

With SimpleLogin, you can send an email from your alias. Sign In with Apple doesn't allow for this, and will likely never do as that's not the scope of the service.

Apple did announce a new server to protect your email address, and we'll analyse it as soon as it comes out.

### PGP encryption

![PGP encryption](/blog/vs-burnermail/6.png)

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) allows you to encrypt your emails so your email service can't read the email content. This adds another layer of security, especially for popular email services that don't have PGP built in like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo. 

This method of encryption **significantly increases the security of the messages** you exchange online. 

PGP is provided by default by some email services such as Protonmail or enabled with existing email services via PGP softwares.

SimpleLogin [adds support for PGP on March 2020](/blog/introducing-pgp/). Burner Mail doesn't support PGP at the moment. 


### Crypto Payments

![Crypto payments](/blog/vs-burnermail/7.png)

Sign In With Apple is free (as SimpleLogin is on the free tier), but doesn't allow to hide your identity. 

It's still tied to your Apple ID and ecosystem.

With SimpleLogin, you can pay with Crypto and avoid having other financial instution lurk into your data!

**We currently support Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, Ethereum, Litecoin, and USD Coin.**


### HaveIBeenPwned integration

![HaveIBeenPwned](/blog/vs-burnermail/8.png)

On all free and paid plans, SimpleLogin integrates with HaveIBeenPwned and lets you know if your alias is exposed in a mail breach. 

This integration is important as it **allows you to quickly turn the alias off as soon as the breach happens**, and protect yourself from unwanted emails or bigger problems that may arise from a data breach (such as stolen identities and/or credit fraud)

Burner Mail does suggest the use of HaveIBeenPwned on their site, but they don't have an active feature protecting your existing aliases.


#### Ease of Use

![What do you get](/blog/vs-burnermail/9.png)

Sign in with Apple is doing a great job by providing an easy-to-use and intuitive way to introduce people to email aliases. 

UX/UI is one of the challenges for SimpleLogin so email alias can be more mainstream and available to the more people.

We welcome any feedback from existing SimpleLogin users on our UX/UI, so if there's something you'd like to see, don't hesitate to let us know!


#### Conclusions

![Conclusions](/blog/vs-burnermail/10.png)

In conclusion, we believe SimpleLogin could be better for you if you're looking for a privacy-focused solution more than a mainstream hide my email solution.

Apple provides a turnkey solution for easily hide your personal details when subscribing to new services and newsletters.

However, if you need to secure your email content with PGP, add unlimited email domains and have a **more complete experience overall**, SimpleLogin will probably be a better solution for you and your business.
