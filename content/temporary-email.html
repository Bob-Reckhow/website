                Thanks to SimpleLogin technology, you can also <strong>send</strong> or <strong>reply to</strong> emails from an alias.

                  <p>It may happen that some websites arbitrarily decide to block SimpleLogin domain. Hopefully, since most of our users use SimpleLogin use responsibly this only happens in a few edge cases. If that happens we encourage you to contact the website and ask them to unblock the domain name. If they have a sincere sense of privacy they will understand and make the necessary changes.<br>
                  To prevent that from happening you can also <a href="https://simplelogin.io/docs/custom-domain/add-domain/">add your own custom domain</a> to SimpleLogin. That way you will be able to <strong>generate a disposable email address</strong> with a domain that only you can use.</p>

            This has to be one of the best burner mail extensions I have ever tried. Believe me I tried quite a lot of them üòÖ. The closest that comes in smoothness wise is paced email. But Simple Login is ahead of them with regards to privacy. Even Burner mail (a highly rated burner mail extension) is not as good as SimpleLogin. It in just a couple of months has become an integral part of my workflow TBH.

            It's awesome. It's even better when you pay the small subscription fee, and if you want to use your own domains and more. It's not just a Browser extension, it's also a mobile app. I have used it for around 6 months now with a yearly subscription. There are tons of things you can do with your account. It's being actively developed, so you can suggest ideas and give feedback straight to the developers. Pay for the subscription, help keep this great open source project going! Highly recommended!

            This is one of the best Email Alias Services I have used. I have tried burner email, anon daddy paced email and a few more, but Simple Login has come up on the top each time on each feature. I believe this is a must have for both privacy and productivity enthusiast being one of the rare services which can cater to both niches.

            I found out about SimpleLogin in a Reddit group and it sounded perfect for my needs. After using it for a month I do find it a great privacy solution. I paired it with an encrypted email provider so Google stops reading my email and now I don‚Äôt have to give me address to anyone thanks to SimpleLogin!! I use the browser add-in for brave and the iPhone app.

            This is the best throwaway Email app I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve tried many. This one is smooth and works great and easy to find, select, and create. I wish the settings screen worked as it generates an error saying ‚Äúthis is not In the correct format‚Äù so it won‚Äôt open, but outside of that, I love this app. I recommend. Feedback would be to get the setting screen working and allow us to change the settings just like what‚Äôs available on the website. Thanks!

          <div class="mb-3">I used to be excited when receiving new emails.</div>
          <div class="mb-3">But thanks to <b>thousands of data breaches</b>, to the <b>200 billions data broker market</b>, my inbox is now full of unsolicited, impossible-to-unsubscribe and personalized cold emails.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">
            When we use our personal email everywhere, it becomes our online identity and our activity can be easily linked together. VPNs, password managers, Ad Blockers don't help here: we are tracked by our email address.
          </div>

          <!-- <div class="mb-3">And I can no longer count on spam filters: my bank emails are put in Spam and obvious phishing is in Inbox. Do you know 85% of all emails are spam?
          </div> -->

          <div class="mb-3 font-weight-semi-bold">That‚Äôs why I started SimpleLogin to have control over the emails we receive.</div>
          <div class="mb-3">And so we can finally be protected from data breaches, cross-site tracking, personalized advertising.</div>
          <div class="mb-3">Since our launch in 2020, we‚Äôve helped over 250.000 people gain back control over their inbox and I‚Äôd love for you to give it a try.</div>
          <div class="mb-3 font-weight-semi-bold">In 2022, we‚Äôve been acquired by <a href="https://proton.me/mail/">ProtonMail</a> to help in their fight for a more private and free Internet.</div>
          <div class="mb-3">Sincerely,</div>
