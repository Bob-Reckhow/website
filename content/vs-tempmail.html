Instead of giving out your one address to everybody, create new forwarding addresses easily to give instead, and they’ll all send the emails you get to the same place for you. This gives you much better security, privacy and control over your email. If the company you give the alias to has a breach, you can just replace the alias instead of your whole darn email. If the service you give it to spams and won’t stop, you can easily cut ties right then and there. You can compartmentalize by using different emails for different things, keeping your online profiles from being tied together. Simple Login actually checks all the right boxes: free, open source, easy to use, and bug-free. You can also check out Anonaddy for similar (though slightly harder to use) option, and guerrillamail for temporary emails. Was recommended to me by YouTube channel Techlore, glad to know about this criminally underrated app.",

Secondly, and most importantly, they have privacy and security focused policy. And get this: they don’t paywall essential features. You could literally use it for free. Their premium plan is only $2.99/month, less than a cup of coffee. Please, please, please spread the words if you can. And support if you can. Thanks to everyone at SimpleLogin.",

Some time ago my primary personal Email address appeared in data breaches, even from trusted businesses who were simply unfortunate victims of cyberattacks. Once your address is exposed out on the web, there is no undoing that. You get spammed relentlessly by malicious actors and it’ll continue indefinitely. The only way to escape is to go through the hassle of making a new Email address and assigning it to your every online account. SimpleLogin changes the game. It works almost entirely seamlessly, doesn’t feel clunky and the customisation is superb. Great website and applications, too. Like a password manager generating unique passwords for every account, SimpleLogin can do just the same for your Email addresses. So, why four stars? Though I cannot emphasise enough how close SimpleLogin gets, nothing’s perfect. A tags and filtering system for SimpleLogin aliases (including in the keyboard, perhaps) would be fantastic for digging around my plethora of aliases. SimpleLogin, you’re on the right track. Keep it up, I am happy to support you with what little I can offer.",

The ability to create your own subdomains for concealing your true email address from spammy websites is just second to none. I highly recommend the premium subscription, it’s worth every penny being able to customize catch-all email addresses on the fly. I’ve had no problems so far; it’s simple and easy to use, and well documented and great UI as well.",

Have a unique email address for every service you use- This increases privacy as accounts can't be linked via common email addresses. This also increases account security as a unique email is now required along with your (hopefully) unique password to login. 2. Forward emails to multiple email accounts- If you have an account (eg Netflix) where you want to share the emails with a partner/friend/colleague etc you can easily have SimpleLogin forward emails to both, or multiple addresses without having to add those addresses to the service directly. Forwarding addresses can be switched on and off easily too. 3. Save money on paying for many alias addresses with your email provider by utilising SimpleLogin to create the aliases, great for ProtonMail accounts. 4. Easily switch your email service provider without having to manually change multiple account email addresses, simply update the forwarding address in SimpleLogin to point at your new email provider. There is a free tier so you can try without having to subscribe and you might find the free tier provides enough, although I think the subscription is worth it.",

            You’ve just found the right way to do email my friend! Instead of giving out your one address to everybody, create new forwarding addresses easily to give instead, and they’ll all send the emails you get to the same place for you. This gives you much better security, privacy and control over your email. If the company you give the alias to has a breach, you can just replace the alias instead of your whole darn email. If the service you give it to spams and won’t stop, you can easily cut ties right then and there. You can compartmentalize by using different emails for different things, keeping your online profiles from being tied together. Simple Login actually checks all the right boxes: free, open source, easy to use, and bug-free. You can also check out Anonaddy for similar (though slightly harder to use) option, and guerrillamail for temporary emails. Was recommended to me by YouTube channel Techlore, glad to know about this criminally underrated app.

            Seriously, I can’t recommend this enough. First off, they have a really well designed and well functioning app, which is way more than I can say for other email forwarding/disposal email out there. Most are web-based. Secondly, and most importantly, they have privacy and security focused policy. And get this: they don’t paywall essential features. You could literally use it for free. Their premium plan is only $2.99/month, less than a cup of coffee. Please, please, please spread the words if you can. And support if you can. Thanks to everyone at SimpleLogin.

            This is the best throwaway Email app I’ve ever used. I’ve tried many. This one is smooth and works great and easy to find, select, and create. I wish the settings screen worked as it generates an error saying “this is not In the correct format” so it won’t open, but outside of that, I love this app. I recommend. Feedback would be to get the setting screen working and allow us to change the settings just like what’s available on the website. Thanks!

            My new favourite toy. Some time ago my primary personal Email address appeared in data breaches, even from trusted businesses who were simply unfortunate victims of cyberattacks. Once your address is exposed out on the web, there is no undoing that. You get spammed relentlessly by malicious actors and it’ll continue indefinitely. The only way to escape is to go through the hassle of making a new Email address and assigning it to your every online account. SimpleLogin changes the game. It works almost entirely seamlessly, doesn’t feel clunky and the customisation is superb. Great website and applications, too. Like a password manager generating unique passwords for every account, SimpleLogin can do just the same for your Email addresses. So, why four stars? Though I cannot emphasise enough how close SimpleLogin gets, nothing’s perfect. A tags and filtering system for SimpleLogin aliases (including in the keyboard, perhaps) would be fantastic for digging around my plethora of aliases. SimpleLogin, you’re on the right track. Keep it up, I am happy to support you with what little I can offer.

            SimpleLogin is very easily one of the best apps I’ve ever used. The ability to create your own subdomains for concealing your true email address from spammy websites is just second to none. I highly recommend the premium subscription, it’s worth every penny being able to customize catch-all email addresses on the fly. I’ve had no problems so far; it’s simple and easy to use, and well documented and great UI as well.

            Not sure why but this review keeps getting removed. Trying again- SimpleLogin should be used by anyone that has an email address. Why use SimpleLogin? 1. Have a unique email address for every service you use- This increases privacy as accounts can't be linked via common email addresses. This also increases account security as a unique email is now required along with your (hopefully) unique password to login. 2. Forward emails to multiple email accounts- If you have an account (eg Netflix) where you want to share the emails with a partner/friend/colleague etc you can easily have SimpleLogin forward emails to both, or multiple addresses without having to add those addresses to the service directly. Forwarding addresses can be switched on and off easily too. 3. Save money on paying for many alias addresses with your email provider by utilising SimpleLogin to create the aliases, great for ProtonMail accounts. 4. Easily switch your email service provider without having to manually change multiple account email addresses, simply update the forwarding address in SimpleLogin to point at your new email provider. There is a free tier so you can try without having to subscribe and you might find the free tier provides enough, although I think the subscription is worth it.
