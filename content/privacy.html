          </p>
          <p>

          <b> Our Use of Cookies </b>
          <p>
              A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.  Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
          </p>
          <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:  </p>

          <p>- Authentication: we use cookies to identify you when you visit our website and as you navigate our website.</p>

          <p>- Security: we use cookies as an element of the security measures used to protect user accounts, including preventing fraudulent use of login credentials, and to protect our website and services generally.

          <p>- Analysis: we use cookies to help us to analyze the use and performance of our website and services</p>

          <p>
              We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics gathers information about website use by means of cookies.

          <b>Email Addresses</b>
          <p>
              We may collect your email address, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. This may occur, for example, if you sign up to receive an email newsletter, or enter a promotion.  If you have provided your email address to us, we use it only for the purposes for which it is provided.  We will not use your email address to contact you for unrelated reasons.

            We may collect other information from you when you register with our Site in order to use various features.  Such information could include your name, profile picture, and password if you sign up using email-password (as opposed to using social login such as Facebook, Github or Google).

          <b>Additional Rights of EEA (European Economic Area) Residents</b>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

            You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us addressed to the following: <br>
            SimpleLogin, 147 BD Henri Sellier, 92150, France.

          <b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b>
          <p>
              We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Site, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new services or change existing ones.  <br>
              If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information, or we are going to use any personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change.  <br>
              If you do not consent, your personal information will be used as agreed to under the terms of the privacy policy in effect at the time we obtained that information. By using our Site or services after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy. We will use information previously obtained in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained from you.
          </p>
