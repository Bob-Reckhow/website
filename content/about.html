          I built SimpleLogin to help people protecting their online identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started as a software engineer in a <a href="https://www.criteo.com">big advertising company</a>, then tech guy in several startups, both as employee and co-founder. It strikes me that almost everyone I work with understands privacy risk but <em>very few</em> takes measures to protect their online identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018 I started creating SimpleLogin as a side project, mostly for myself. Fast forward a couple of months, the prototype starts to be more and more stable and I decided to quit my full time job to dedicate more time on my passion: creating useful products, things that I can proudly tell my children later.
        </p>
        <p>
          SimpleLogin is a tool to create a different "persona" for every service. It's for anyone who thinks privacy risk is real and we can't naively believe all things "big guys" say, especially the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19531945">Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity</a>! 

          Unfortunately that requires some efforts and knowledges but with the right tools, we should be able to protect ourselves without sacrificing (too much) comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an indie, solo-maker until now and the subscription fee help me continue to maintain and add more useful features into SimpleLogin. Don't hesitate to drop me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/nguyenkims">Twitter</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenkims/">LinkedIn</a>.

          For those who are interested in technical details: the web app is written in Python/Flask in back-end and Vanilla JS on the front-end. The email part is managed by Postfix and handlers written in Python. Everything is hosted in AWS Paris datacenter. The main database is Postgres managed by RDS.
