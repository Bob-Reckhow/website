            Such a powerful and versatile tool. You can easily create, edit, reassign, and remove aliases and amazingly you are allowed 15 on the free plan. Indispensable for managing online accounts, automatically organizing emails, and preventing spam. The random names it comes up with for the aliases also tend to be very entertaining. The app UI is simple and intuitive but very effective, as is the website itself. Can’t recommend this enough.<br><br>

                    Yes! SimpleLogin as a Spam filter feature. An automatic spam filter such as <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/" target="_blank">SpamAssassin</a> works by analyzing the content of an incoming message and comparing it to a bank of predefined criteria or rules. It then assigns a score or value to the incoming message based on its content. Once the message scores above a predetermined threshold, the <strong>filter will classify it as spam</strong> and take the necessary action, such as deleting or moving it to a separate folder.
