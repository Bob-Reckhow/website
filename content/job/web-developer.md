#### About SimpleLogin

As our privacy is threatened, SimpleLoginâ€™s mission is to help people protect their online privacy. We don't strive to become a unicorn but to create a sustainable business and have a meaningful impact. 

All SimpleLogin code is [open source](https://github.com/simple-login/) and our work happens on GitHub. Having a single person on the web side until now, we are looking for someone to help deliver new features faster.

#### Why joining us?

- Work on an open source product (it's fun!), interact daily with SimpleLogin community.
- Fair compensation. Including salary, bonus and company shares.
- Work-life balance: there's no such thing as "work hard, play hard" at SimpleLogin. Your code is better when you're happy and healthy. 
- Be part of the founder team.
- 100% remote (might be restricted to France at the moment, due to the our received funding)
- Make a positive impact.

#### Skills Needed

- Solid experiences in web development, preferably in Python(Flask, Sqlalchemy).
- Good knowledge about Html, Js, Css.
- Famililar with Git-based environments (Pull request, Code review, etc)
- Good communicator. Most works happen on GitHub so a good writing skill is a must.
- (Plus) good sense of UX/UI.
