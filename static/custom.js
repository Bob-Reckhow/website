      these ad-generated revenue? <br>
      SimpleLogin, with a transparent pricing model (you know where our revenue comes from) with a single
      product that focus solely on improving the login experiences yet still giving users total control over
      their data, does not have any incentive to utilize your user data. <br>

                  privacy-first and tracker-free product.

      {
        q: `Do you plan to release a SDK to support native, windows, etc app?`,
        a: `Yes absolutely! We started with the web platform simply because they can be used for mobile app as
        well via a Android WebView or IOS UIWebView. We plan to provide a SDK and some examples for Android,
        iOS, Windows quite soon. Stay tuned!`,
      },
      {
        q: `How does the "revenue sharing" work?`,
        a: `
        The current advertising model is based on an unfair model where big players (Google, Facebook, etc)
        take almost all benefit and app/content creators get almost nothing. We strongly believe a
        sustainable model should be fair: our partners should get an important part of the revenue because
        together with SimpleLogin, we provide a great login experience to user while respecting user privacy
        at the same time.
      <br>

        The revenue formula is still work-in-progress as we need to take into account different factors
        (mostly payment processing fee and tax rate) but hopefully this can give you a rough idea on how it
        works.
      <br>

        The payment period is monthly and works as following: <br>
        - a user John opts for the premium subscription. John pays 20$/year. After processing fee and taxes,
        let's assume SimpleLogin receives 12$ net (this number is quite optimist in France ðŸ˜‰), which is
        1$/month. Half of this will be distributed to partners. <br>
        - John uses N apps that implement SimpleLogin: each app will get an equal part of the revenue.
      <br>

        Let's put this into a concrete example. The following numbers are of course hypothesis.<br>
        - the average number of app a user uses per month is about 10, half of them implement SimpleLogin,
        that makes N=5. <br>
        - you have a website/app that has 1M users, half of them use SingleLogin and 10% of them are paying
        customers, that is 1 000 000*0.5*0.1=50 000 paying users.
      <br>

        Using our formula, each month you will receive: <br>
        monthly_revenue = total_number_of_paying_user * 1/2 * monthly_net_revenue / average_app_number <br>
      <br>

        monthly_revenue = 50000 * 1/2 * 1 / 5 = 5000$
      <br>`,
      },
    ],

        Another reason of having this limit is the PGP encryption is a heavy process, supporting a bigger size can put a big load on our server. <br>

        A longer answer is the email protocol is designed to be highly resilient and an email is almost never lost. If SimpleLogin cannot deliver the email to your mailbox, we will notify you so you can take appropriate action. You can also set up a secondary mailbox in addition to your primary mailbox that can be used as a backup.
